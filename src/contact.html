				Hello, I'm James, also known as Atomic online. Currently working on
				making computers do funny things and learning how to do so.

					<summary>"jame"?</summary>
					<p>
						Jame is a nickname between me and my friends, becuase it sounds
						funny to say. (Try it!)
					</p>
					<p>
						When I wanted to make a website, I had a bunch of ideas for domain
						names. Sadly, a lot of "jame".tld names were already taken -
						jame.com, jame.dev. Others are super expensive due to such a short
						domain name. I had an idea to use "ja.me", but of course that was
						taken along with all other 2-letter domain names. So, I simply added
						"real" to the start and here we are :-)
					</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Why a website?</summary>
					<p>A few reasons:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Practice setting up a Linux machine as a webserver. I learned how
							to use Docker and Docker Compose after doing this as well.
						</li>
						<li>
							Make a personal website that's easy to link to for people to know
							about me and my creations.
						</li>
						<li>
							Probably would look good as a resume to show that I know how to
							make websites/servers from scratch.
						</li>
