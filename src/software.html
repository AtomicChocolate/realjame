			<h2>Nothing here for now.</h2>
			<i>And probably won't be, for some time.</i>
			<p>
				Right now, I'm busy working on Into the Wilderness, so I've taken time
				away from learning web development and stuff. I'm not sure when I'll
				make progress, but I would be spending most of it on learning, such as
				by working on The Odin Project, which you can see on my GitHub. When I
				get around to actually making things, expect things like simple tools
				similar to websites like 8mb.video or the like. (Not talking about video
				software I'm just talking about simple easy tools that can be accessed
				on my website)
			</p>
			<p>
				I would also like to learn non web dev related programming languages,
				such as C so I can try making Wii homebrew apps for no reason.
